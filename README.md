How I Approach Designing Software
I try to think about the big picture first when I'm making software. What is it meant to do, and how will the user experience be? So I can work on it one small job at a time, I break it up. That meant deciding what things I wanted in my scene, where I wanted them to go, and how to add textures and lighting to make the scene feel full.


New Design Skills I Learned
I learned a lot about how to arrange things in a 3D area, how lighting can change the mood, and how to use textures to make things come to life. I also got better at finding the right balance between design and speed, especially when working with models and effects.

My Design Process
I used an iterative method. I didn't try to build everything at the same time. I began with a simple base and added features one at a time, starting with the models and moving on to textures and lighting. I checked each piece as I put it together to make sure it fit well with the others.

How I’ll Use These Design Tactics in the Future
I'm going to use this method of building in steps and testing as I go in future projects for sure.  It keeps things from getting too crowded and helps find bugs quickly.  Also, writing down my style choices helped me stay on top of things, and I plan to keep doing that.

How I Approach Developing Programs
Setting up the framework of my program (just enough to run something simple) is the first thing I do. Then I add features one by one.  I use comments to keep track of what each line of code does and try to write clean code.  When the code is well-organized and simple to read, it's a lot easier to find bugs.

New Development Strategies I Used
I used SceneManager for this project to keep my code flexible and easy to work with.  I also learned how to use shaders better and how to use outside tools for math and textures, such as GLM and STB Image.  I was able to improve my project.

The Role of Iteration in My Development
The key was iteration.  It's okay that I didn't get everything right the first time.  As I learned more, I kept going back and making things better.  Every time I added something new, I made sure it worked well with what I already had made.  I was able to dodge big problems later on because of this.

How My Coding Has Evolved
I was just trying to get things to work at first.  By the end, I was thinking more about how to write code that works well and is easy to read.  I used code more than once when I could and paid more attention to speed, especially when working with lights and textures.  During the stages, I definitely felt more confident in my ability to use OpenGL.

How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals
Computer science gives me the tools to create things that matter—to solve problems, build new tools, or even just bring ideas to life. Whether I work in cybersecurity, game design, or app development, these skills help me move closer to my long-term career goals.

How Computational Graphics Help in Education
Computing gives me the skills to make important things, like tools that solve problems or things that bring ideas to life.  A long-term goal of mine is to work in cybersecurity, game design, or app creation. These skills help me get closer to that goal.

How Computational Graphics Help Professionally
It is very helpful to be able to make or understand 3D environments in the real world.  It is helpful to have these skills when making training simulations, building user interfaces, or working with AR/VR.  I feel more ready to take on those kinds of jobs or projects now.
